For hierarchies in table :
- [ManagerEmployeeKey] [INT] NULL

optimized delete from a partition with clustered columnstore index:
1. Create empty table TABLE_COPY with same schema
2. Switch the partition
3. Drop the table

Parquet:
  - column-oriented binary file format
  - automatic statistics are turned on by default
Avro: row-based json format, that has logical type timestamp

Gen2 storage strucutre:
- /{SubjectArea}/{DataSource}/YYYY/MM/DD/FileData_YYYY_MM_DD.csv

fact  -> hash / clustered columnstore index
dim   -> replicated (if tables are large go with hash)
stage -> round-robin / no-partition

stage-table -> round-robin / heap / no-partition

  PARTITION (ID RANGE LEFT FOR VALUES (1, 1000000, 2000000)
);

Indexes:
- clustered columnstore index (edfault): highest data compression and overall query performance for large tables
    - not good for temporary / stage tables
    - not good for small tables
- heap: transient data / stage tables
- clustered and nonclustered indexes: fast when one row or a few rows need to be retrieved
    - queries that benefit are the ones that use a highly selective filter on the clustered index column
    e.g. WITH ( CLUSTERED INDEX (id) );

`Auto Loader` provides a structured streaming source called cloudfiles; it also supports schema drift

`Query Acceleration` supports .csv and .json

`Azure Event Grids`: event-driven publish-subscribe model (reactive programming)
`Azure Event Hubs`: multiple source big data streaming pipeline

Databricks:
- high concurrency:
- automated:
- interactive:

NOTES:
- When moving from databaseto to datawarehouse (dimensional model) -> denormalize
- NEVER hash on date
- Folder/Files with prefi `.*`, `_*` are ignored when reading in synapse as external data source
- Maximized compression -> ALTER INDEX ALL on table1 REBUILD
- `Annotations` are additional informative tags that you can add to specific resources: pipelines,datasets, linked service, triggers.
	They can then be used for filtering the resources
